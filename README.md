## Inspiration ‚ö°Ô∏è
**8 out 10 students** in the age group of 10-16 feel the traditional education system to be boring. Consecutive fast-paced **classes only help 30%** of the students to understand. Developing countries which consists of **85% of the world** doesn't focus on physical education while women safety being one of the highest concern. Regular blackboard teaching with the test on pen and paper and dimensionalization of 3D objects to 2D for easy teaching deprives students of depth analysis. Thus making regular teaching boring, hectic, teacher dependant and less effective. `We present Airclass`. Air Class, your virtual instructor, and companion are here to provide assistance in academics as well as martial arts for you, with the luxury of staying indoors. It uses the technology of Augmented Reality.
Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that exist in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.

## What is it? ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Air Class is an AR based application in which instructors assist you in fitness, self-defense and major subjects of science. With AR and 3d as the next bloom in education our software focuses on the same . With our software any person can learn topics starting from working of heart to martials arts with the power of AR and the comfort of home. A famous proverb goes `All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy`. We take this very seriously by intergrating a recreational game which can be only unlocked after completing a minimum amount of course or by finish a quiz. With our software we make sure `learning is fun`. 

#### Workflow 

- A person who wants to get information on a specific topic can click on it and the instructor will provide explanations with pictorial representation.
 For example, if a person wants to learn about the human heart, he or she can select the topic. The teacher will proceed to explain about it in detail with a 3D model of the human heart.

- To maintain a healthy combination of learning and breaks, a person can use our quiz and gaming options available, where a person can test their knowledge in a fast track interactive quiz and if they score well, a gaming option becomes available. Thereby helping a person gain constant motivation to do better.

## How we built it üòâ
We build the Virtual classroom using AR Foundation and AR core in unity. We took characters from the unity store and made some from blender, used scenes for different subjects, and used a backlink using c# functional component to link between scenes. The animator controller was used to animate the object and play the audios at the right time. The quiz app and puzzle were built using vanilla javascript, HTML, and CSS we used the hyperlink from the app itself to the corresponding websites. 

## Challenges we ran into ü•∫
Characters imported from blender and unity store made the applications heavy and slow to process. We didn't have high-tech computers so the development process was slow and the machine kept lagging. For every subject, we needed to record the audio separately as we were not able to integrate python rest APIs with c#. We tried to integrate blockchain with air classroom so that students get points on the amount of time they are learning from the app which points would then be converted to crypto equivalent but due to time shortage was not able to manage. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòé
Being a duo of javascript developers this was the first time we tried building Augmented Reality in unity. We are proud that we have solved an actual problem:
- Airclass will help students to learn and understand complex working and diagrams with the power of AR
- Airclass will help parents and students create a healthy combination of learning and gaming
- Eliminates the need for physical classroom
- Encourage people to take care of their health and fitness.
- Guide women in self-defense.

Even though my fellow teammate fell sick and wasn't able to contribute, I didn't lose hope and stayed up all night. It was tiring, but fun as well. I am most proud of the fact that this product will be able to help many students across the globe.

## What we learned ü§ì
Being a group of javascript developers, we tried our hands on Unity this time. We learned how to create and handle multiple scenes , perform hyperlinking , onclick run and movements of the AR model , adding animations to blender character. We also tried to add voice for each scene although not able to integrate python with c# but were able to build a text to speech voice translator. The quiz app and puzzel which we built gave us the confidence on building more native javascript web apps.

## What's next for Airclass üî•
- The application can be used for teaching correct precautions to people so that they stay safe from viral diseases like the Coronavirus. This way, it serves the demand for healthcare and awareness.
- It can be used for guiding women in different fields like tailoring, cooking, driving, and academics. It can also be used to teach the proper steps of self-defense to women so that they can protect themselves during an assault. All these advancements will lead to women's empowerment.
- Tie-ups with major E-Learning Platforms can be done to provide interactive educational content of all types, starting from exams, professional to life skills.
- Tie-ups with corporate to inculcate AR-based meetings for more immersive graphical-based presentations.
