## Inspiration ⚡️

## What is it? ⛹️‍♂️
Air Class is an AR based application in which instructors assist you in fitness, self-defense and major subjects of science. With AR and 3d as the next bloom in education our software focuses on the same . With our software any person can learn topics starting from working of heart to martials arts with the power of AR and the comfort of home.

## How we built it 😉
We build the Virtual classroom using AR Foundation and AR core in unity. We took characters from the unity store and made some from blender, used scenes for different subjects, and used a backlink using c# functional component to link between scenes. The animator controller was used to animate the object and play the audios at the right time. The quiz app and puzzle were built using vanilla javascript, HTML, and CSS we used the hyperlink from the app itself to the corresponding websites. 

## Challenges we ran into 🥺
Characters imported from blender and unity store made the applications heavy and slow to process. We didn't have high-tech computers so the development process was slow and the machine kept lagging. For every subject, we needed to record the audio separately as we were not able to integrate python rest APIs with c#. We tried to integrate blockchain with air classroom so that students get points on the amount of time they are learning from the app which points would then be converted to crypto equivalent but due to time shortage was not able to manage.
